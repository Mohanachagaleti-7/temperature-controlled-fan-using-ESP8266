# temperature-controlled-fan-using-ESP8266
This project is an IoT-based Temperature Controlled Fan using ESP8266, DHT11 sensor, and Blynk app. It continuously monitors room temperature and humidity and displays the data in real time on a mobile phone. When the temperature rises above 31°C, the fan turns ON automatically and turns OFF when it drops, saving energy and improving comfort.
